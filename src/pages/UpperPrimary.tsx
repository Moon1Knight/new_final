              Our learning is centered around big concepts that inspire thought and action with a focus on intellectual, emotional, and social growth. The approach in Upper Primary School is guided by a desire to honor our students' need for independence by empowering them to be their own advocates, to engage with teachers directly, to take ownership in their academic work, to solve their own problems, to provide support to each other, to transition between rooms and buildings on their own, and to choose their own cocurricular classes.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A hallmark of our program is the emphasis we place on teaching students <span className="font-semibold text-purple-700 underline decoration-purple-300 decoration-2">how to learn</span>. We focus on teaching students the skills and strategies that promote growth and competence. When our Upper Primary Schoolers move on to their respective Secondary Schools after Grade 8, they are not only recognized for their academic work, but they are praised for their <span className="bg-yellow-100 px-1 rounded">mature emotional intelligence</span>. Our students are organized, articulate and they advocate for themselves â€“ exactly what they need to navigate the high school years and beyond.

              Our Upper Primary School provides a <span className="font-bold text-purple-700">framework of academic challenge</span> that encourages students to explore real-world concepts and issues, challenge assumptions, think critically and acquire skills that they will need to apply throughout their educational and future professional journeys.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The strength of our program stems from the belief that learning is more meaningful when students are provided opportunities to explore concepts through the lens of different subject areas. This is called <span className="bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-1 rounded font-semibold text-gray-800">interdisciplinary learning</span> and it is a hallmark of our approach. It is also the key to teasing out our students' innate creativity by providing them multiple avenues to approach problem-solving. We teach for the <span className="underline decoration-purple-400 decoration-2 font-medium">understanding of real-life concepts</span> rather than the simple regurgitation of knowledge.

              Another strength of the academic program in our Upper Primary School is that teaching extends far beyond the content and concepts in a given subject area. We invest time to integrate the teaching of key skills that help our students become <span className="bg-green-100 px-1 rounded">better learners</span> as well as <span className="bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded">better people</span>. They include critical-thinking, reflection, organization, collaboration, affective, information literacy, communication, transfer, creative thinking, and media literacy skills.

These also help students become more aware of the learning process and understand their strengths and challenges as learners.
